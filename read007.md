## Readings 07 :
### REST
**1. Who is Roy Fielding?**
 He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

**2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**
Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements.

**3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**
 
 is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world and assign a verb to it.

**4. What does a GET do?**
Retrieve information from systems

**5. What does a POST do?**
Add something to another system

**6. What does PUT do?**
Replace something in another system

**7. What does PATCH do?**

Partial update something in another system
